# CPG-for-Leg-Spine-coordinated-gait
This is the code for generating leg-spine coordinated gaits for a quadruped robot with an active spine.
The model is proposed in the following paper that was published at the 2023 TAROS conference:
Paper: CPG-based locomotion control of a quadruped robot with an active spine(https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-43360-3_15)
